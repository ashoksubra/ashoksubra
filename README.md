- 👋 Hi, I’m @ashoksubra
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. Electronics & Communication graduate, but like most others, switched to system & application s/w and database world.  After 30 years in IT industry, took a long break to focus on my other passion of teaching India Classical music (which is still going on). Realized, once an engineer, always an engineer. Did Drone engineering course successfully with Udacity in 2018. Though did not do much with it (someday, i will),
-    now into Data/Decision Science path. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science tools by doing PG Diploma in that with UT Austin (online) course through Greatlearnings. Interesting and engaging. Revamping my skilss in Python, Statistics, Vizualization of Business Data etc
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Indian Classical music related tools development and Election Data Analysis,  Predictive modeling with multivariate random variables
